XBee Data Acquisition PCB
-------------------------

PCB for remote unit, including XBee with battery monitor and photodiode
counter.

The PCB is intended to fit inside a cylindrical watermeter along with batteries,
and so is designed to allow a number of different configurations, including
having the XBee mounted on a separate board. Because of the presence of
batteries the XBee aerial pattern may be severely distorted. A possibility of
having two batteries in parallel through Schottky diodes is provided. A
divider circuit for the battery voltage is also provided for the case that
the batteries provide a higher voltage than the circuit power supply (via
a voltage regulator). The photodiode circuit is mounted on a separate board
that will straddle an interrupter wheel for counting revolutions of the meter.
