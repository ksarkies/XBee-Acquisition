XBee Data Acquisition Hardware Libraries
----------------------------------------

These libraries define a number of hardware helper functions for the AVR that
may be reused in other projects.

The hardware features of different processor types are defined in the
defines-*.h header files. The defines.h file selects the appropriate defines
file given the processor type used at compile time.

The project.h header file has a list of project specific features that are
independent of the hardware features of the processor used.
