XBee Data Acquisition XBee Utility
----------------------------------

This is a GUI application written in C++ and using QT4. This allows user
interaction at a low level with an XBee. Assembles and sends API commands to an
XBee on a serial port (or USB-serial port via an adapter).

The .pro file needs to be changed if the library and include paths are
different.

Download and compile libxbee according to the included instructions. The
latest version at this time is 3.0.9. Install the libraries. Then qmake and make
the program.
