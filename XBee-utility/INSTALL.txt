Basic Installation
==================

To use this, unpack into a directory which by default will be serial-debug-tool.
Obtain QextSerialPort from http://qextserialport.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the
tarball into the directory qextserialport. This directory is assumed to be at 
the same directory level as serial-programmer-pc; you can change this in
avrserialprog.pro. Make sure that you have QT4 installed. Go into the
qextserialport directory and execute:

$ qmake-qt4
$ make clean
$ make

This will build the qextserialport libraries. Copy or link the libqestserialport
libraries to a suitable place in the library path, e.g.:

$ sudo cp -d libqextserialport.so* /usr/lib

Return to the serial-debug-tool directory. The serial port used is preset in the
code. To change this edit the serialdebugtoolmain.cpp file near the top. Execute:

$ qmake-qt4
$ make clean
$ make

This will build the application. Copy the binary to a suitable place and invoke with:

$ sudo serial-debug-tool
