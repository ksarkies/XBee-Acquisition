XBee Data Acquisition Control
-----------------------------

A background control process written in C++. Its purpose is to manage the XBee
acquisition network and interface to an externally or locally running user
interface. This allows a small low-power on-site Linux machine to monitor the
system and communicate over LAN or WAN to a GUI running on a separate PC.

Download and compile libxbee according to the included instructions. The
latest version at this time is 3.0.9. Install the libraries. Then make
the program.
