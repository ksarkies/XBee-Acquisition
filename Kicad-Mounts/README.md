XBee Data Acquisition XBee/LED Mountings
----------------------------------------

This board provides a mounting PCB for the LED and a mounting PCb for the XBee
with matching connector for right-angle mount to the main PCB.

XBee footprint is taken from Ian McInerney's library:
https://github.com/imciner2/KiCad-Libraries RF_OEM_PARTS.lib and footprints.mod

The LED mount provides for two LEDs VSMY2850 and SFH4056 reverse mounted (under
the board and facing through a cutout) and a top mounted LED SFH4258.

27 November 2014: Flip XBee over, adjust XBee footprint, reduce size the of the
                  two boards, interchange Rx and Tx.
