XBee Data Acquisition PCB
-------------------------

This is a small test board PCB for a remote unit that can run on low power.

xbee-node-atmega48

This includes an XBee with ATMega48 battery monitor and counter. It takes an
input voltage 5V or more and produces 3.3V power for the electronics.

xbee-node-attint4313

This board is similar to the above but analogue input is taken to the XBee as
the ATTiny4313 doesn't have analogue capability.
